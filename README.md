# nodeHangMan

A command line version of a Hang Man game.

I stuck with the same theme I used for the HTML version which was words from the movie, "The Fifth Element."
Now that I have more knowledge of JavaScript I was able to create a better workflow and user experience. I may go back and attempt to enhance the HTML version in the future.

### Gameplay:

* Run command to start game.

* Display the spaces available in the current word(showString method) console log the current score and incorrect guesses remaining.

* Prompt the user for their guess.

* Check the letter and the word to see if has been guessed correctly.

* If the word has not been fully guessed, re-display the spaces available and correct letters(showString method) console log the current score and incorrect guesses and prompt the user for their guess.

* If the word has been guessed correctly add one to the players score. Prompt the user to determine if they would like to continue playing or exit the game. If they with to continue, reset the guesses remaining and valid guesses if used, display the spaces available for the next word, console log the current score and incorrect guesses and prompt the user for their guess.

* If all of the words have been guessed, congratulate the user on a perfect round and end the game.

### Instructions

<!-- Done -->

1. Navigate to the root of your project and run `npm init -y` &mdash; this will initialize a `package.json` file for your project. The `package.json` file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project.

<!-- Done -->

2. Make a `.gitignore` file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

```
node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
```

## Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Constructor Word Guess

### Overview

This homework assignment is **optional**.

In this unit's assignment, you will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.

## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.

2. Your solution should have, at minimum, three files:

* **Letter.js**: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

  * A string value to store the underlying character for the letter

  * A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

  * A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly

* **Word.js**: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. That means the constructor should define:

  * An array of `new` Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word

  * A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in `Letter.js`) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.

  * A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in `Letter.js`)

* **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js` and:

  * Randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it

  * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses

3. `Letter.js` *should not* `require` any other files.

4. `Word.js` *should only* require `Letter.js`

5. **HINT:** Write `Letter.js` first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with `Word.js`

6. **HINT:** If you name your letter's display function `toString`, JavaScript will call that function automatically whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: <https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console>)
